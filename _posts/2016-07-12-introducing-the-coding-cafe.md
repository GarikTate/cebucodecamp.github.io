## Introducing the Coding Cafe

This week we're introducing the Coding Café by <a href="http://cebucodecamp.org/">Cebu Code Camp</a>!

<img class="size-medium wp-image-173" src="http://cebucodecamp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Coding-Café-212x300.png" alt="Coding Café This Saturday!" width="212" height="300" />

What's a Coding Café? It's a place — to code, to learn, to tinker, to share, to hangout. Just drop by and do stuff! There's no agenda, no speakers. But we've got good, stable Internet for ya! :)

<b>So, what can you do? </b>Actually, <i>whatever you want</i>!

* Work on your side project.
* Put your headphones on and explore that new Java library.
* Show someone a new IPython trick.
* Fire up a beamer and practice your meetup talk.
* Contribute to an OS project … ask someone for suggestions. :)

We're starting this Saturday the 16th of July. The café will be open from 2pm to 6pm — every 2nd and 4th Saturday of the month at the TIDE. No RSVP necessary.

For the first event we've created a Beer Challenge — get a free beer or softdrink by solving a few tech riddles. For details see the event description.
