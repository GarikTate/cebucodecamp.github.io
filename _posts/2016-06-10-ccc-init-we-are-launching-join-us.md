## CCC.init, we are launching, join us!

Heya friends, thanks for dropping by.

We are launching a new project and forming a new community that is aimed for software engineers here in Cebu!

We intend to kick off this project with the first group learning session, this coming June 29th. To register and to learn more about this event, please visit the [event page](https://cebucodecamp.doorkeeper.jp/events/47276).

The journey towards becoming a master in building software is long and tough (but fun!). Tough in a way, that it's not enough to master just the tools and technologies, but also to follow and adopt a good process, learn the good patterns around code, and to form the right mindset.

If you are wondering how to grow and develop your code crafting skills, then you have come to the right place. If you are looking for people to learn from, then this is the group. If you are looking for a place to work as an engineer, then this community might be a starting point for you to know what's out there.

It doesn't matter where you are in your journey as a software engineer, you can either be a sensei who have years of experience, or a fresh graduate eager to make your mark in the world. You are all welcome.

If you are still in school, then this is a good opportunity for you to get an idea what it will be like to work as a software engineer, and bring yourself ahead by learning what is not taught in school. Please join us.

We strive to keep a platform or technology agnostic stance. We strive to make the community relevant for all kinds of development background, from JS, Ruby, Python, Swift, Java, PHP, .NET, C, C++, and we will form a bridge with other coding communities to offer a more in-depth, technology-focused discussions.

We are treating this as an experiment, and we are eager to learn how we can grow this idea. We will make adjustments along the way, to make this project a good fit for our community. So please come with an open mind and share your ideas how we can shape this.

In our first event, we are going to introduce the Cebu Code Camp project, and show a video talk from [Marty Cagan](http://svpg.com/team/) of [Silicon Valley Product Group](http://svpg.com/), from last year's [Craft Conference](http://beta.craft-conf.com/), about the challenge of building great products, despite having a good engineering team.

Please register for this first event on [this page](https://cebucodecamp.doorkeeper.jp/events/47276), or via the link below.
