## CTL meets at Trax Technologies

*Date:* Jun 13, 2017<br />
*Attendees:* Olan (Host), Mark (Scribe), Belmer, Yohei, Albert, Froi, Murat

### Olan talked about Google Analytics
Using [GA](https://www.google.com/analytics/) to track users in their app<br />
App is hosted in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)<br />
Exports data to Gsheet, and uses reporting tool to better present data<br />

### Interactive Q&A: Using Google Cloud Platform
Asked, and most are using AWS in their infrastucture. Wondering, what will compel them to move to [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), and no one can point to a concrete basis. Primary reason can be cost, since GCP prices are lower than AWS. BUT, it is outweighed by the risks in moving. So, lower price is not enough to convince them to move. Though, if starting a new, might be an easy consideration.

### Albert demoed Tensorflow
Demo showed how to train ML, to classify images of roses, tulips, and dandelions.<br />
[Tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0) can be found at Google Developers Codelab<br />
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), is a python framework to do machine learning<br />
Demos the [neural playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/)<br />
Used it to classify road projects as part of audit efforts<br />
Tensorflow can use the machines GPU, to speed up the training<br />
[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard) looks nice, for observing local performance<br />
What are use cases? What can it be used for? *Something to ponder for the next meeting.*<br />
