# Coding Cafe

### Announcement

We are taking a break from hosting a Coding Cafe at the moment. Neither of us (Mark and Murat) has the bandwidth to promote and regularly host it.

We wish to host it again, in the future.

Until then, you might want to checkout the [co-working spaces](local-spaces.html) in town, and see if they are having an open house, or have an upcoming open event you can attend to.
