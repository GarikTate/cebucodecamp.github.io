# Hello Cebu!

We're software developers, tech leaders, QA engineers and generally nerds in Cebu.
Our mission is to help create a strong tech community here in the Visaysa.

Come say hi at a meetup, shoot us questions or just roam around the site.

The website is hosted on GitHub, so please [help us improve it](https://github.com/cebucodecamp/cebucodecamp.github.io).
