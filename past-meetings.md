## Updates
Just anything about anyone in their respective organizations.

## Introduction by Garik
Garik is the new member of the group. He is the CEO of Blvnp Inc, a publishing company. Garik main strength is actually on the area of Finance & Marketing but he is very interested on Software. He has a bit of programming background too using PHP. And most importantly he loves Island Hoping.. ;-)
