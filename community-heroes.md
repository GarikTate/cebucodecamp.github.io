# Community Heroes

Our goal is a strong, healthy tech community in Cebu.
Where techies help each other. 
Where senior devs pass on their knowledge to junior devs.
Where devs, no matter their experience, share their knowledge.

A comumnity only works if *everyone* shares.
You pay forward by sharing yourself.
And if you learn something useful, you pay it back—also by sharing.

Organizing meetups, holding a talk knowledge, teaching others, 
moderating a workshop—all this is a lot of work.

That's why we want to recognize the indviduals that decide to give back:
(We make mistakes—so if we forgot someone, please let us know, or [open a PR](https://github.com/cebucodecamp/cebucodecamp.github.io).)
